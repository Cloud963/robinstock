# RobinStock Overview

## 🎯 Vision

RobinStock is a decentralized trading platform that brings tokenized real-world stocks to the blockchain. By combining traditional financial markets with DeFi infrastructure, we're creating a bridge between two worlds that enables:

- **24/7 Trading**: Trade tokenized stocks anytime, anywhere
- **Fractional Ownership**: Own fractions of expensive stocks
- **DeFi Integration**: Use stocks as collateral, provide liquidity, earn yields
- **Transparency**: All transactions on-chain and verifiable
- **Accessibility**: No minimum investment, no geographic restrictions
